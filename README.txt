Marbles is a match five game written in Swift and SceneKit. The rules are as follows:
- In each round three random marbles will drop
- Player then gets to move any marbles, as long as there is a connecting path
- Remove marbles and get points by matching 5 or more same-colored marbles
- Game continues until the whole board is full

Feel free to use the code any way you want, just remember to note the original source ;)
